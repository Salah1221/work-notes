The purpose of this site is to document the issues encountered at work and the solutions applied to resolve them. Below is a list of all the problems identified so far:
- [[Memory Leak]]: This is a bug related to `StateHasChanged()` that caused a memory leak.
- [[Application not working at Release]]: The application was ran in release mode and it didn't behave like it did in debug mode. (in MAUI Hybrid)
- [[Stuck at the Loading Screen]]: That was a bug caused by a mistake made while migrating from Blazor to MAUI Hybrid.
