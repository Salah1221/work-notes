- [[Memory Leak]]: I encoutered a bug related to `StateHasChanged()` that caused a memory leak, and I explained how to mitigate it in the article.
- [[Application not working at Release]]: After I finished working on the prayer times application, I ran the application in release mode and it didn't work as expected. I talked more about that problem in detail and how I solved it.
- [[Stuck at the Loading Screen]]: That was a bug caused by a mistake I made while migrating from Blazor to MAUI Hybrid.
